# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#incrementing i 20 values up 1-20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#when i is 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
#i starts at the first value and ends at the second value
